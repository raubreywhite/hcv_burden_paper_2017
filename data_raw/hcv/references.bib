	abstract = {Published estimates of liver fibrosis progression in individuals with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are heterogeneous. We aimed to estimate stage-specific fibrosis progression rates and their determinants in these individuals. A systematic review of published prognostic studies was undertaken. Study inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) presence of HCV infection determined by serological assays; (2) available information about age at assessment of liver disease or HCV acquisition; (3) duration of HCV infection; and (4) histological and/or clinical diagnosis of cirrhosis. Annual stage-specific transition probabilities (F0--{\textgreater}F1, ... , F3--{\textgreater}F4) were derived using the Markov maximum likelihood estimation method and a meta-analysis was performed. The impact of potential covariates was evaluated using meta-regression. A total of 111 studies of individuals with chronic HCV infection (n = 33,121) were included. Based on the random effects model, the estimated annual mean (95\% confidence interval) stage-specific transition probabilities were: F0--{\textgreater}F1 0.117 (0.104-0.130); F1--{\textgreater}F2 0.085 (0.075-0.096); F2--{\textgreater}F3 0.120 (0.109-0.133); and F3--{\textgreater}F4 0.116 (0.104-0.129). The estimated prevalence of cirrhosis at 20 years after the infection was 16\% (14\%-19\%) for all studies, 18\% (15\%-21\%) for cross-sectional/retrospective studies, 7\% (4\%-14\%) for retrospective-prospective studies, 18\% (16\%-21\%) for studies conducted in clinical settings, and 7\% (4\%-12\%) for studies conducted in nonclinical settings. Duration of infection was the most consistent factor significantly associated with progression of fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: Our large systematic review provides increased precision in estimating fibrosis progression in chronic HCV infection and supports nonlinear disease progression. Estimates of progression to cirrhosis from studies conducted in clinical settings were lower than previous estimates.},

	abstract = {In Sweden, infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been a notifiable disease since 1990, when diagnostic methods became available. Blood donor screening indicated that about 0.5\% of the Swedish population (9 millions) had been HCV infected. Here we present the Swedish hepatitis C epidemic based on data from all the HCV notifications 1990-2006. During this time about 42,000 individuals (70\% men) were diagnosed and reported as HCV infected. The majority (80\%) were born in 1950 or later, with a high percentage (60\%) born in the 1950s and 1960s. Younger people, 15-24 years old at notification, were reported on the same level each year. The main reported routes of HCV transmission were intravenous drug use in 65\%, blood transfusions/products in 6\%, and sexual in 2\%, though unknown or not stated in 26\%. Approximately 6,000 of all notified individuals have died during the study period. To conclude, the Swedish HCV epidemic is highly related to the increase of intravenous drug use in the late 1960s and 1970s, with a high proportion of people now chronically infected for more than 25 years, resulting in an increase of severe liver complications in form of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore the unchanged number of notifications of newly infected younger people indicates an ongoing HCV epidemic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease, end-stage cirrhosis, and liver cancer, but little is known about the burden of disease caused by the virus. We summarised burden of disease data presently available for Europe, compared the data to current expert estimates, and identified areas in which better data are needed.
METHODS: Literature and international health databases were systematically searched for HCV-specific burden of disease data, including incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and liver transplantation. Data were collected for the WHO European region with emphasis on 22 countries. If HCV-specific data were unavailable, these were calculated via HCV-attributable fractions.
RESULTS: HCV-specific burden of disease data for Europe are scarce. Incidence data provided by national surveillance are not fully comparable and need to be standardised. HCV prevalence data are often inconclusive. According to available data, an estimated 7.3-8.8 million people (1.1-1.3\%) are infected in our 22 focus countries. HCV-specific mortality, DALY, and transplantation data are unavailable. Estimations via HCV-attributable fractions indicate that HCV caused more than 86000 deaths and 1.2 million DALYs in the WHO European region in 2002. Most of the DALYs (95\%) were accumulated by patients in preventable disease stages. About one-quarter of the liver transplants performed in 25 European countries in 2004 were attributable to HCV.
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that hepatitis C is a major health problem and highlight the importance of timely antiviral treatment. However, data on the burden of disease of hepatitis C in Europe are scarce, outdated or inconclusive, which indicates that hepatitis C is still a neglected disease in many countries. What is needed are public awareness, co-ordinated action plans, and better data. European physicians should be aware that many infections are still undetected, provide timely testing and antiviral treatment, and avoid iatrogenic transmission.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence rate and causes of cirrhosis in a Norwegian population. We also sought to assess the degree of underreporting of cirrhosis to the Norwegian Death Registry.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All 1264 patients treated at Aker University Hospital in the period January 1999 to March 2004 who were given a diagnosis indicating cirrhosis, chronic liver disease or symptoms possibly attributable to cirrhosis were screened retrospectively. A search in the registry of histological diagnoses at Department of Pathology was also carried out. Based on the results of histological examinations and non-histological criteria, cirrhosis was confirmed in 194 patients. Calculations of the incidence rate of cirrhosis and frequencies of the various etiologies were based on 93 patients living in the catchment area of the hospital. Causes of death were retrieved from the Norwegian Death Registry.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of cirrhosis was 134 per million per year. The majority of cases were due to alcoholic liver disease (53\%), followed by viral liver disease (12\%), various autoimmune liver diseases (12\%), hemochromatosis (4\%) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (3\%). No etiology was established in 16\%, a group with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, indicating that some of these cases were possibly caused by NASH. Among 105 deaths in this cohort of 194 cirrhotic patients, the diagnosis of cirrhosis was absent in the Norwegian Death Registry in 30\% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of cirrhosis in Norway is relatively low, with alcohol as the most important etiologic factor. Significant underreporting to the Norwegian Death Registry was observed.},

	doi = {10.1053/jhep.2002.36806},
	abstract = {Much controversy surrounds the issue of the natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Many authorities view the disease as inexorably progressive with a high probability of advancing over time to cirrhosis and occasionally hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and, therefore, likely to be responsible for causing death. Others regard chronic hepatitis C as having a variable outcome, the majority of infected persons not dying from the disease, but more likely from the comorbid conditions that so often accompany infection by this agent, or from more common medical conditions. Disagreements probably derive from the manner of conduct of the study and the populations studied. Efforts to determine natural history are handicapped by the primary characteristics of the disease, namely that its onset rarely is recognized and its course is prolonged exceedingly. Thus, different outcomes have come from retrospective rather than from prospective studies, but both have concluded that at least 20\% of chronically infected adults develop cirrhosis within 20 years. More recent studies that used a retrospective/prospective approach, focusing largely on young infected individuals, have produced different results. Among these young people, particularly young women, spontaneous resolution of the viral infection is more common than previously thought and cirrhosis has been identified in 5\% or fewer of them. The major failing for all groups studied, young and old, is that natural history studies have rarely exceeded the first 2 decades, so that outcome beyond this time is not known, other than through modeling. Several host-related and extraneous factors probably affect the natural history.},

	abstract = {Quantitative estimates of the current and future burden of hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease are required to plan a public health response to the HCV epidemic with regard to both prevention and treatment. A forward projection model was used to estimate the numbers of both current and former injecting drug users (IDUs) who acquired HCV and progressed to moderate and severe disease in Glasgow and Scotland during 1960-2030. The model was designed to synthesize information on the incidence and cessation of injecting drug use, the incidence of HCV infection among IDUs, the rate of HCV disease progression, and the annual number of IDUs developing HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis. During 2003, a total of 17,400 and 42,900 HCV-infected IDUs were estimated in Glasgow and Scotland, respectively; this compares with approximately 5,000 and 13,900 diagnosed, respectively, and 13,200 and 32,200 with chronic HCV, respectively. The number of IDUs developing HCV-related decompensated cirrhosis in Scotland is estimated to double between 2000 and 2020. As many as 16\% and 27\% of former IDUs in 2005 aged 30-39 and 40-49 years, respectively, were estimated to have moderate disease, which highlights the potential benefit of targeting HCV testing at former IDUs who belong to these age groups. In conclusion, the identification and treatment of a larger proportion of former IDUs with HCV disease and education about the importance of minimal alcohol consumption are needed to help achieve a greater impact on the future morbidity and mortality of this disease.},

	abstract = {Substantial reductions in hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID) cannot be achieved by harm reduction interventions such as needle exchange and opiate substitution therapy (OST) alone. Current HCV treatment is arduous and uptake is low, but new highly effective and tolerable interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments could facilitate increased uptake. We projected the potential impact of DAA treatments on PWID HCV prevalence in three settings. A dynamic HCV transmission model was parameterized to three chronic HCV prevalence settings: Edinburgh, UK (25\%); Melbourne, Australia (50\%); and Vancouver, Canada (65\%). Using realistic scenarios of future DAAs (90\% sustained viral response, 12 weeks duration, available 2015), we projected the treatment rates required to reduce chronic HCV prevalence by half or three-quarters within 15 years. Current HCV treatment rates may have a minimal impact on prevalence in Melbourne and Vancouver ({\textless}2\% relative reductions) but could reduce prevalence by 26\% in 15 years in Edinburgh. Prevalence could halve within 15 years with treatment scale-up to 15, 40, or 76 per 1,000 PWID annually in Edinburgh, Melbourne, or Vancouver, respectively (2-, 13-, and 15-fold increases, respectively). Scale-up to 22, 54, or 98 per 1,000 PWID annually could reduce prevalence by three-quarters within 15 years. Less impact occurs with delayed scale-up, higher baseline prevalence, or shorter average injecting duration. Results are insensitive to risk heterogeneity or restricting treatment to PWID on OST. At existing HCV drug costs, halving chronic prevalence would require annual treatment budgets of US \$3.2 million in Edinburgh and approximately \$50 million in Melbourne and Vancouver.
CONCLUSION: Interferon-free DAAs could enable increased HCV treatment uptake among PWID, which could have a major preventative impact. However, treatment costs may limit scale-up, and should be addressed.},

The objectives of this WHO informal consultation included the following: (1) defining a strategy to estimate the global burden of disease (GBD) associated with HCV infection in terms of morbidity and mortality, (2) describing the natural history of HCV infection in terms of morbidity and mortality, and (3) identifying areas for which more research is needed. The GBD project is an attempt to examine all causes of morbidity and mortality using an approach common to all conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO) already has estimated the burden of disease associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and is now about to conduct the same analysis for HCV infection. A review has been conducted to estimate the prevalence of HCV infection by age, gender, and region. These figures can be used to estimate incidence, although there are a number of areas of uncertainty. Combined with natural history parameters, incidence estimates could be used to estimate the future burden due to current infections. However, the present model is not validated and requires calibration before it can be used. A consensus was reached over the strategies to be used to (1) estimate the current burden due to past infections and (2) estimate the future burden due to current infections. Provisional expert consensus was reached over natural history parameters and cofactors that influence them. However, systematic literature reviews and meta-analysis are preferable for obtaining estimates to be included in models. Areas deserving future research include (1) obtaining a better estimate of HCV infection prevalence by age groups, (2) characterizing the various morbidity states associated with HCV infection and their disability weights, (3) understanding the long-term natural history of HCV infection beyond 20 years after infection, and (4) estimating the prevalence (and numbers of) of HCV infection among the drug-using population worldwide.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis is the most common indication for liver transplantation (LTX) world-wide. The prevalence of HCV infections is much lower in Norway than in most other countries from which data on HCV infection and liver transplantation have been published.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with HCV infection referred for evaluation of a possible LTX between 1990 and 2005 were included in the study. Their clinical status, biochemical parameters and risk factors were recorded. All patients were followed until 1 January 2005 irrespective of transplantation status.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were included; 80\% were males and 18\% were non-Caucasians. Previous intravenous drug abuse (28\%) and exposure to contaminated IgG products (15\%) were the most common routes of infection. In 45/51 (88\%) of the evaluated patients at least one risk factor for rapid progression of HCV disease was identified. Twenty-seven patients were accepted on the waiting list. The MELD (model for endstage liver disease) score for the accepted patients was significantly higher than that for the patients who were not listed because they were found to be too healthy (18.4 versus 12.1, p{\textless}0.01). Twenty-four patients (89\% of those listed) received a liver allograft; their 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates following LTX were 81\%, 68\% and 68\%, respectively. Two patients needed a second transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS: A low number of HCV-infected patients have so far been evaluated for LTX in Norway. The present study demonstrates that almost all of the HCV patients progressing to cirrhosis and being evaluated for LTX in Norway have additional risk factors for development of cirrhosis.},

	abstract = {Physicians are reluctant to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in active injection drug users (IDUs). An important reason for this is concern about reinfection after successful treatment. However, little is known about this apparent risk; because of lack of protective immunity, reinfection with HCV seems possible. Here, I discuss several cases of probable reinfection in IDUs, 2 of which occurred during or after successful treatment for HCV infection. In a Norwegian trial, 69 IDUs who had abstained from drug use for {\textgreater}or=6 months were treated for HCV infection; of these, 27 tested negative for HCV RNA at 6 months of follow-up (sustained virological response). At 5 years of follow-up, 9 (33\%) of the 27 IDUs with sustained virological response had returned to drug use, but only 1 case of reinfection was observed. In another study, 395 subjects with sustained virological response were followed with yearly testing for HCV RNA. Although injection drug use was the route of HCV transmission in 40\% of the subjects, only 7 (2\%) experienced a late relapse of HCV infection. It has not been determined whether any of these cases were actual reinfections. Available data suggest that the rate of long-term response to treatment for HCV infection is excellent in IDUs.},

The aims of our study were to determine the total and cause-specific mortality in patients infected with chronic hepatitis C in a community-based setting in northern Norway. This prospective cohort study included 1010 HCV-positive patients diagnosed with recombinant immunoblot assay between 1 January 1990 and 1 January 2000, with a median observation time from diagnosis to follow-up of 7 years. Data were collected from medical records in the period between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2006. Time and cause of death were ascertained from the Norwegian Causes of Death Register. Age-adjusted death rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were compared with those of the general Norwegian population. In total, 122 deaths were recorded. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of survival was 88\% at 14 years. The SMR in the cohort relative to the general population was 6.66. Most of the excess deaths in both genders were because of liver-related causes, those associated with a drug-using lifestyle and suicide. The statistically significant increase in SMRs ranged from 4.2 for death by cancer in women to 64.6 for liver disease in women. There was no statistically significant increase in SMRs from cardiovascular disease in either gender or from cancer in men. In conclusion, our study shows that the death rate in patients infected with hepatitis C is 6.66 times higher than in the general Norwegian population.},

	abstract = {Injecting drug use is the main risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in most developed countries. HCV antiviral treatment (peginterferon-α + ribavirin) has been shown to be cost-effective for patients with no reinfection risk. We examined the cost-effectiveness of providing antiviral treatment for injecting drug users (IDUs) as compared with treating ex/non-IDUs or no treatment. A dynamic model of HCV transmission and disease progression was developed, incorporating: a fixed number of antiviral treatments allocated at the mild HCV stage over 10 years, no retreatment after treatment failure, potential reinfection, and three baseline IDU HCV chronic prevalence scenarios (20\%, 40\%, and 60\%). We performed a probabilistic cost-utility analysis estimating long-term costs and outcomes measured in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing treating IDUs, ex/non-IDUs, or no treatment. Antiviral treatment for IDUs is the most cost-effective option in the 20\% and 40\% baseline chronic prevalence settings, with ICERs compared with no treatment of £ 521 and £ 2,539 per QALY saved, respectively. Treatment of ex/non-IDUs is dominated in these scenarios. At 60\% baseline prevalence, treating ex/non-IDUs is slightly more likely to be the more cost-effective option (with an ICER compared with no treatment of £ 6,803), and treating IDUs dominated due to high reinfection. A sensitivity analysis indicates these rankings hold even when IDU sustained viral response rates as compared with ex/non-IDUs are halved.
CONCLUSION: Despite the possibility of reinfection, the model suggests providing antiviral treatment to IDUs is the most cost-effective policy option in chronic prevalence scenarios less than 60\%. Further research on how HCV treatment for injectors can be scaled up and its impact on prevalence is warranted.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of developing advanced fibrosis associated with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection among injecting drug users (IDUs) who underwent an autopsy.
METHODS: A longitudinal cohort design was applied, in which the stage of liver fibrosis in anti-HCV positive IDUs with or without chronic HCV infection was assessed in liver tissue from autopsies performed up to 35 years after HCV exposure. The cohort originated from 864 IDUs consecutively admitted for drug abuse treatment 1970-1984. Stored sera, mostly drawn at the time of admission for drug treatment, were available in 635 subjects. 220 out of 523 anti-HCV positive subjects had died before 2009. Liver tissue from autopsies was available from 102/220 subjects, of which 61 were HCV RNA positive. Liver sections were classified according to METAVIR scores for fibrosis. Two pathologists, both blinded for serologic results, scored sections of liver tissue.
RESULTS: Among HCV RNA positive subjects 16.4\% (10/61) had septal fibrosis (F3) or cirrhosis (F4) compared to 2.4\% (1/41) among anti HCV positive/HCV RNA negative subjects (p=0.026). Of 18 HCV RNA positive subjects autopsied {\textless}15 years after HCV exposure none had F3 or F4. Among subjects autopsied {\textgreater}25 years after exposure 35\% (6/17) had F3-F4.
CONCLUSIONS: Among IDUs chronically infected by HCV, 1/3 developed septal fibrosis or cirrhosis 25 years or more after exposure.},

	abstract = {AIM AND BACKGROUND: The Nordic Liver Transplant Registry (NLTR) accounts for all liver transplants performed in the Nordic countries since the start of the transplant program in 1982. Due to short waiting times, donor liver allocation has been made without considerations of the model of end-stage liver disease (MELD) score. We aimed to summarize key outcome measures and developments for the activity up to December 2013.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The registry is integrated with the operational waiting-list and liver allocation system of Scandiatransplant (www.scandiatransplant.org) and accounted at the end of 2013 for 6019 patients out of whom 5198 were transplanted. Data for recipient and donor characteristics and relevant end-points retransplantation and death are manually curated on an annual basis to allow for statistical analysis and the annual report.
RESULTS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis, acute hepatic failure, alcoholic liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are the five most frequent diagnoses (accounting for 15.3\%, 10.8\%, 10.6\%, 9.3\% and 9.0\% of all transplants, respectively). Median waiting time for non-urgent liver transplantation during the last 10-year period was 39 days. Outcome has improved over time, and for patients transplanted during 2004-2013, overall one-, five- and 10-year survival rates were 91\%, 80\% and 71\%, respectively. In an intention-to-treat analysis, corresponding numbers during the same time period were 87\%, 75\% and 66\%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The liver transplant program in the Nordic countries provides comparable outcomes to programs with a MELD-based donor liver allocation system. Unique features comprise the diagnostic spectrum, waiting times and the availability of an integrated waiting list and transplant registry (NLTR).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to document antiviral treatment uptake among former or current people who inject drugs (PWID) with chronic hepatitis C and to explore a possible association between treatment and mortality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a longitudinal cohort study of PWID admitted for drug abuse treatment 1970-1984. The 245 hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA-positive patients alive by the end of 1996 were followed 1997-2012 through linkage to several health registers. Treatment uptake was mainly documented by information on prescription of antiviral medication registered in the Norwegian Prescription Database from 2004. Cox regression, with a time-dependent covariate measuring end-of-treatment, was employed to evaluate mortality after treatment.
RESULTS: At the end of the follow-up, median time since HCV exposure was 36 years, and 19.2\% (47/245) had been prescribed antiviral treatment for chronic HCV infection. No gender difference was observed. Among those alive at the end of the study period, 27.8\% (44/158) had been treated. Relative hazard of death was 0.21 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.68), comparing periods for patients after versus before or without treatment. Mortality rate after treatment was 0.8 per 100 person years (95\% CI 0.3-2.4) compared to 2.8 (95\% CI 2.2-3.5) in untreated patients and before treatment. The most important causes of death among the untreated were drug-related.
CONCLUSIONS: Among PWID infected with HCV, approximately one-fourth of those still alive at a median of 36 years after exposure had received HCV treatment. Treatment was associated with increased survival, probably mainly due to selection bias.},

	abstract = {Research has focused on understanding injecting drug use initiation in the era of HIV/AIDS. However, differences between new and longer-term injecting drug users (IDUs) have not received as much attention. This study examined injecting initiation experience, risk and risk reduction practices, and self-reported HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing practices and infection among new (injecting {\textless} or =4 years) and longer-term IDUs. Data from 3 cross-sectional surveys in 1992, 1994, and 1997 of syringe exchange program (SEP) users in Oslo, Norway, were used. Approximately one fifth of IDUs were new injectors. New IDUs were increasingly indistinguishable from longer-term IDUs in terms of socio-demographics, risk practices, and HIV and HCV testing. The prevalence of HIV infection remained low (5\%); in contrast, approximately two thirds of all SEP users reported being HCV-infected. Known HCV infection status had no impact on syringe sharing; most HCV-infected SEP users reported sharing syringes, regardless of the duration of injecting. The only variable associated with HCV infection was injecting {\textless} or =4 years (adjusted odds ratio = 0.2; 95\% confidence interval = 0.1-0.4). Increased similarity in age between new and longer-term IDUs may have contributed to the rapid spread of HCV infection by facilitating mixing patterns between HCV-infected and -susceptible IDUs.},

	abstract = {In Sweden, infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been a notifiable disease since 1990, when diagnostic methods became available. Blood donor screening indicated that about 0.5\% of the Swedish population (9 millions) had been HCV infected. Here we present the Swedish hepatitis C epidemic based on data from all the HCV notifications 1990-2006. During this time about 42,000 individuals (70\% men) were diagnosed and reported as HCV infected. The majority (80\%) were born in 1950 or later, with a high percentage (60\%) born in the 1950s and 1960s. Younger people, 15-24 years old at notification, were reported on the same level each year. The main reported routes of HCV transmission were intravenous drug use in 65\%, blood transfusions/products in 6\%, and sexual in 2\%, though unknown or not stated in 26\%. Approximately 6,000 of all notified individuals have died during the study period. To conclude, the Swedish HCV epidemic is highly related to the increase of intravenous drug use in the late 1960s and 1970s, with a high proportion of people now chronically infected for more than 25 years, resulting in an increase of severe liver complications in form of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore the unchanged number of notifications of newly infected younger people indicates an ongoing HCV epidemic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tests for hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV enzyme immunoassays) are usually described as positive or negative. Several studies, mainly in blood donors, have found that specimens with low signal/cutoff (S/C) ratios are commonly negative when tested with a recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) or for HCV RNA.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 17 418 consecutive anti-HCV results from a screening program for high-risk veterans; 2986 (17.1\%) samples were anti-HCV-positive, and 490 (16.4\%) had S/C ratios {\textless}or=3.7 (low positive). Additional tests were performed in 1814 anti-HCV-positive individuals.
RESULTS: RIBA was performed in 263 patients with low-positive anti-HCV; results were negative in 86\%, indeterminate in 12\%, and positive in 2\%. Only 16 of 140 individuals (11\%) with low-positive anti-HCV values were HCV RNA-positive, whereas HCV RNA was positive in 90\% of 1435 individuals with high-positive anti-HCV values (P {\textless}0.0001). Compared with those with high-positive anti-HCV, individuals with low-positive anti-HCV values were older (P {\textless}0.0001) and were less likely to have risk factors for HCV (P {\textless}0.0001 for most), multiple increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity values (30\% vs 81\%; P {\textless}0.0001), or positive anti-hepatitis B core antigen (19\% vs 59\%; P {\textless}0.0002). Among 634 individuals with high anti-HCV titers and multiple increased ALT activity values, 95\% were HCV RNA-positive.
CONCLUSIONS: The S/C ratio is important even in high-risk individuals; laboratories should report the S/C ratio along with anti-HCV EIA results and perform supplemental RIBA testing in those with low-positive values to avoid reporting false-positive results.},

METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-two HCV patients listed for LTX in the Nordic countries in a 17-year period were included. For comparison a group of patients with non-viral chronic liver disease (n=1552) was used.
RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-three (90\%) patients received a first liver allograft. HCC was found in 38\% of the explanted livers. Survival at 1, 3 and 5years was 82\%, 69\% and 61\% vs. 85\%, 80\% and 76\% for the comparison group (p{\textless}0.0001), this survival difference was also evident when excluding patients with HCC (p=0.007).

CONCLUSIONS: HCV cirrhosis, which is now also an important indication for LTX in the Nordic countries, and significantly impairs survival following LTX. Concomitant HCC and donor age are the two most important factors contributing to an impaired survival.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis C is both a cause and a complication of chronic renal disease. Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can lead to the immune complex syndromes of cryoglobulinemia and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). The pathogenetic mechanisms for these conditions have not been defined, although they are clearly caused by the chronic viral infection. Management of HCV-related cryoglobulinemia and MPGN is difficult; antiviral therapy is effective in clearing HCV infection in a proportion of patients, but these conditions can be severe and resistant to antiviral therapy. Hepatitis C also is a complicating factor among patients with end-stage renal disease and renal transplants. The source of HCV infection in these patients can be nosocomial. Screening and careful attention to infection control precautions are mandatory for dialysis units to prevent the spread of hepatitis C. Prevention of spread is particularly important in these patients because HCV infection is associated with significant worsening of survival on dialysis therapy, as well as after kidney transplantation. Furthermore, therapy for hepatitis C is problematic, only partially effective, and associated with significant side effects in this population. There are significant needs in both basic and clinical research in the pathogenesis, natural history, prevention, and therapy for hepatitis C in patients with renal disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Curative treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is dependent on early diagnosis. Surveillance of patients at high risk for HCC is a key determinant to achieve this goal, but may be an underutilized tool. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of pre-diagnosis surveillance in patients with HCC in a large population-based cohort and to assess to what extent cirrhosis was known prior to the diagnosis of HCC.
METHODS: All patients diagnosed with HCC during 2000-2009 in The South-Eastern Regional Health Authority, representing 56\% of the Norwegian population, were identified from The National Cancer Registry and the medical records were reviewed.
RESULTS: Fifteen out of 486 patients (3\%) were diagnosed by surveillance. Potential curative treatment was offered to 58\% of the patients who underwent surveillance as opposed to 15\% in the non-surveillance group. Only age ≤ 65 years was an independent predictor of screening in a multivariate model. Almost two thirds of the patients with cirrhosis were unrecognized prior to the HCC diagnosis. Two hundred and fourteen patients (44\%) were non-cirrhotics.
CONCLUSION: Regular HCC surveillance in at-risk populations is virtually not applied in Norway and this may contribute to inferior overall survival. Failure to recognize cirrhosis and a high rate of HCC in non-cirrhotic patients will be limiting factors for the overall effectiveness of a potential surveillance program.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of hepatitis C (HCV) in Northern Europe has not been well described. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and spectrum of hepatitis C infection in the general adult population of Oslo, Norway.
METHODS: The study was part of the Oslo Health Study 2000-2001 and included a random selection of individuals older than 30 years living in Oslo County. Sera from 11,456 participants were screened for anti-HCV (EIA-3), positive samples were confirmed (RIBA-3) and examined for HCV RNA (PCR). All anti-HCV positive patients were offered clinical evaluation. Routine biochemical liver tests were performed. Candidates for HCV treatment were asked to undergo a percutanous liver biopsy.
RESULTS: Among 11,456 participants HCV RNA was detected in 62 (0.5\%) and HCV RNA with raised serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 46 (0.4\%). Anti-HCV was detected in 78 (0.7\%) with a peak prevalence of 1.5\% among subjects 40 and 45 years old. Being anti-HCV positive was associated with being unmarried, unemployed and having low education. Anti-HCV prevalence was higher among subjects with alcohol-related problems compared to those without (4.4\% versus 0.6\%, P {\textless} 0.001). It was also higher among smokers compared to non-smokers (2.0\% versus 0.2\%, P {\textless} 0.001). In 33 liver biopsies, bridging fibrosis was seen in 8 (24\%) and cirrhosis in 1 (3\%). The route of transmission was injecting drug use in 67\%, transfusion in 6\% and unknown in 27\%.
CONCLUSION: In this population-based survey the prevalence of chronic hepatitis C was 0.5\% and ALT was raised in 80\% of those with chronic infection.},

The study included 199 injecting drug users of more than 18 years of age who participated in a needle exchange program. Blood samples were tested for the presence of HCV RNA in serum with a polymerase chain reaction method. HRQOL was measured using the questionnaire SF-36, measuring HRQOL over the last 4 wk. The HCV RNA test was positive in 102 (51\%) and negative in 97 (49\%) subjects. The HRQOL scores of actively injecting drug users were markedly reduced compared to the population norm. However, we did not find poorer HRQOL in injecting drug users with chronic HCV infection than in injecting drug users without HCV infection. HCV RNA positive injecting drug users who were aware of the infection had lower HRQOL scores than those unaware of the infection in 4 of the 8 SF-36 dimensions (general health, physical functioning, physical role, and vitality). HCV RNA negative subjects, who believed they were infected, scored worse in one dimension (general health) compared to those who did not believe they were infected. In conclusion, chronic HCV infection per se did not negatively affect the HRQOL of active injecting drug users. Those who thought they were infected had a lower HRQOL scores than those who believed they were not infected.},

Chronic infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are well-recognized risk factors for cirrhosis and liver cancer, but estimates of their contributions to worldwide disease burden have been lacking.
METHODS: The prevalence of serologic markers of HBV and HCV infections among patients diagnosed with cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was obtained from representative samples of published reports. Attributable fractions of cirrhosis and HCC due to these infections were estimated for 11 WHO-based regions.
RESULTS: Globally, 57\% of cirrhosis was attributable to either HBV (30\%) or HCV (27\%) and 78\% of HCC was attributable to HBV (53\%) or HCV (25\%). Regionally, these infections usually accounted for {\textgreater}50\% of HCC and cirrhosis. Applied to 2002 worldwide mortality estimates, these fractions represent 929,000 deaths due to chronic HBV and HCV infections, including 446,000 cirrhosis deaths (HBV: n=235,000; HCV: n=211,000) and 483,000 liver cancer deaths (HBV: n=328,000; HCV: n=155,000).
CONCLUSIONS: HBV and HCV infections account for the majority of cirrhosis and primary liver cancer throughout most of the world, highlighting the need for programs to prevent new infections and provide medical management and treatment for those already infected.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injecting drug use is an important risk factor for transmission of viral hepatitis, but detailed, transparent estimates of the scale of the issue do not exist. We estimated national, regional, and global prevalence and population size for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in injecting drug users (IDUs).
METHODS: We systematically searched for data for HBV and HCV in IDUs in peer-reviewed databases (Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO), grey literature, conference abstracts, and online resources, and made a widely distributed call for additional data. From 4386 peer-reviewed and 1019 grey literature sources, we reviewed 1125 sources in full. We extracted studies into a customised database and graded them according to their methods. We included serological reports of HCV antibodies (anti-HCV), HBV antibodies (anti-HBc), or HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in studies of IDUs with more than 40 participants ({\textless}100\% HIV-positive) and sampling frames that did not exclude participants on the basis of age or sex. With endorsed decision rules, we calculated prevalence estimates with anti-HCV and anti-HBc as proxies for exposure and HBsAg as proxy for current infection. We combined these estimates with IDU population sizes to calculate the number of IDUs with positive HBV or HCV statuses.
FINDINGS: We located eligible reports with data for prevalence of anti-HCV in IDUs for 77 countries; midpoint prevalence estimates suggested 60-80\% of IDUs had anti-HCV in 25 countries and more than 80\% of IDUs did so in 12 countries. About 10.0 million (range 6.0-15.2) IDUs worldwide might be anti-HCV positive. China (1.6 million), USA (1.5 million), and Russia (1.3 million) had the largest such populations. We identified eligible HBsAg reports for 59 countries, with midpoint prevalence estimates of 5-10\% in 21 countries and more than 10\% in ten countries. Worldwide, we estimate 6.4 million IDUs are anti-HBc positive (2.3-9.7 million), and 1.2 million (0.3-2.7 million) are HBsAg positive.
INTERPRETATION: More IDUs have anti-HCV than HIV infection, and viral hepatitis poses a key challenge to public health. Variation in the coverage and quality of existing research creates uncertainty around estimates. Improved and more complete data and reporting are needed to estimate the scale of the issue, which will inform efforts to prevent and treat HCV and HBV in IDUs.

The aim of our study was to characterize the clinical outcomes of both hepatic and extrahepatic morbidity in patients infected with HCV in a community-based setting in Northern Norway.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 1010 HCV-positive patients diagnosed by recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA), between 1 January 1990 and 1 January 2000. Questionnaires were sent to those physicians in Northern Norway who had requested the RIBA tests during the relevant period. Data were collected from medical records in the period between 1 January 2004 and 30 June 2006. Access to confidential information was obtained from the Norwegian Directorate of Health.
RESULTS: Median age at follow-up was 39 and 41 years in females and males, respectively. In patients with positive HCV RNA status following results were found: Alanine aminotransferase was elevated in 27.4\%, decompensated liver disease in 2.9\% and hepatocellular carcinoma in 0.4\%. Median observation period from estimated acquisition of the disease to follow-up in these patients was 26 years. Depression was reported in 10.7\% of chronic infected subjects. Renal failure caused by membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis occurred in 0.2\%.
CONCLUSIONS: In an unselected HCV-RNA positive population severe liver disease developed in a sub-group of patients. These observations suggest that chronic HCV disease in relatively young subjects may cause a substantial burden on the health system in the future.},

The aim of the study was to characterize CHC patients referred to a large university hospital in Norway, identify treatment barriers, and investigate the course and outcomes of treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective observational cohort study, all anti-HCV-positive patients referred to Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, for treatment evaluation during the period 2007-2010 were included. Demographics, clinical, laboratory, and treatment results were obtained from electronic medical records.
RESULTS: A total of 256 patients were included. The patients were young (mean age 36 ± 10.3), with a high prevalence of genotypes 3 (55\%) and 1 (43\%) and low levels of fibrosis (77\% {\textless}F2). The majority of patients were former or current injection drug users (85\%). Treatment uptake among patients attending the clinic was 47\% (n = 91). Treatment was significantly less common in patients who were unemployed, those who had nonattendances during clinical evaluation, those with genotypes 1 or 4, those ≥50 years of age, and patients with no biopsy. For patients initiating treatment, the total sustained virologic response (SVR) rate was 63\% (by complete case analysis 73\%). For genotypes 1 and 3, SVR was achieved in 44\% and 75\%, respectively, by intention to treat.
CONCLUSIONS: A high treatment uptake of CHC patients in a cohort with high prevalence of injection drug use was found. Young age, low degrees of fibrosis, and good patient attendance ensured a high rate of SVR.},

	abstract = {The incidence of newly acquired hepatitis C infection has diminished in the United States. This decline is largely because of a decrease in cases among IDUs for reasons that are unclear and, to a lesser extent, to testing of blood donors for HCV. The virus is transmitted by blood, and such transmission now occurs primarily through injection drug use, sex with an infected partner or multiple partners, and occupational exposure. Most infections become chronic, and therefore the prevalence of HCV infections is high, with about 3 million Americans estimated, to be chronically infected. HCV is a leading cause of cirrhosis, a common cause of HCC and the leading cause of liter transplantation in the United States. The disease spectrum associated with HCV infection varies greatly. Various studies have suggested that 3\% to 10\% of chronically infected patients will develop cirrhosis over a 20-year period, and these patients are at risk for HCC. Persons who are older at the time of infection, patients with continuous exposure to alcohol, and those coinfected with HIV or HBV demonstrate accelerated progression to more advanced liver disease. Conversely, individuals infected at a younger age have little or no disease progression over several decades. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection often is suggested by abnormalities in ALT levels and is established by EIA followed by confirmatory determination of HCV RNA. Several sensitive and specific assays are automated partly for the purposes of detecting HCV RNA and quantifying the viral level. Although there is little correlation between viral level and disease manifestations, these assays have proven useful in identifying those patients who are more likely to benefit from treatment and, particularly, in demonstrating successful response to treatment as defined by an SVR. Liver biopsy is useful in defining baseline abnormalities of liver disease and in enabling patients and healthcare providers to reach a decision regarding antiviral therapy. Noninvasive tests do not provide the information that can be obtained through liver biopsy. Information on the genotype of the virus is important to guide treatment decisions. Genotype 1, most commonly found in the United States, is less amenable to treatment than genotypes 2 or 3. Therefore, clinical trials of antiviral therapies require genotyping information for appropriate stratification of subjects. Recent therapeutic trials in defined, selected populations have shown clearly that combinations of interferons and ribavirin are more effective than monotherapy. Moreover, trials using pegylated interferons have yielded improved SVR rates with similar toxicity profiles. Results continue to show, however, that the SVR rate is less common in patients with genotype 1 infections, higher HCV RNA levels, or more advanced stages of fibrosis. Genotype 1 infections require therapy for 48 weeks, whereas shorter treatment is feasible in genotype 2 and 3 infections. In genotype 1, the lack of an early virologic response ({\textless} 2 log decrease in HCV RNA) is associated with failure to achieve an SVR. The SVR is lower in patients with advanced liver disease than in patients without cirrhosis. Ongoing trials are exploring the usefulness of combination therapy in various populations. Preliminary experience in IDUs, individuals coinfected with HIV, children, and other special groups suggests similar responses are achievable in these populations. Patients with acute hepatitis C may be treated, but specific recommendations for antiviral treatment must await further evaluation of the rate of spontaneous clearance of the virus and determination of the optimal time to initiate treatment. Preventive measures beyond blood-banking practices include prompt identification of infected individuals, awareness of the potential for perinatal transmission, implementation of safe injection practices, linkage of drug users to drug treatment programs. and implementation of community-based education and support programs to modify risk behavior. Some of these measures have been implemented successfully in the control of HIV infections, and it stands to reason that they would be valuable for reducing HCV transmission. Future advances in the diagnosis and management of hepatitis C require continued vigilance concerning the transmission of this infection, extending treatment to populations not evaluated previously in treatment trials, and the introduction of more effective therapies.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne infection that can lead to progressive liver failure, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. In developed countries, the majority of HCV infections are transmitted via injecting drug users (IDUs). Despite effective antiviral treatment for HCV, very few active IDUs are treated. Reluctance to treat is partially due to the risk of reinfection. We develop a mathematical model of HCV transmission amongst active IDUs, and examine the potential effect of antiviral treatment. As most mathematical models of interventions utilise a treatment function proportional to the infected population, but many policy implementations set fixed yearly targets for specific numbers treated, we study the effects of using two different treatment terms: annually treating a proportion of infecteds or a fixed number of infecteds. We examine the behaviour of the two treatment models and find different bifurcation behaviours in each case. We calculate analytical solutions for the treatment level needed for disease clearance or control, and observe that achievable levels of treatment can result in control or eradication across a wide range of prevalence levels. Finally, we calculate the sensitivity of the critical treatment threshold to the model parameters, and find that for a given observed prevalence, the injecting duration and infection risk play the most important role in determining the treatment level needed. By contrast, the sensitivity analysis indicates the presence (or absence) of immunity does not alter the treatment threshold. We conclude by discussing the public health implications of this work, and comment on the importance and feasibility of utilising treatment as prevention for HCV spread amongst IDUs.},

	abstract = {It is well known that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection may progress to cirrhosis and is linked to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies have shown that compensated HCV-cirrhosis is related to a certain morbidity and mortality in European patients, but little is known in regard to the clinical outcomes of a similar group of patients in the United States. This study investigated this category of patients in terms of the incidence of decompensation, development of HCC, mortality, and the predictive risk factors for morbidity and mortality. The potential effects of interferon (IFN) therapy on outcomes of the disease also were assessed. A total of 112 patients with compensated HCV-cirrhosis and a documented history of either intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) or transfusion were consecutively enrolled. The mean follow-up interval was 4.5 (2-7.7) years. The cumulative probabilities for decompensation and development of HCC were 22.2\% and 10.1\% in 5 years, with an estimated yearly incidence of 4.4\% and 2.0\%, respectively. The cumulative survival probability was 82.8\% from entry and 51.1\% from decompensation in 5 years, with estimated yearly events of mortality and liver transplantation of 3.4\% and 9. 8\%, respectively. It was found that age at entry and initial exposure, initial levels of albumin, platelet count, and prothrombin time (PT) were predictive risk factors for developing decompensation, whereas age at entry and initial exposure, history of transfusion, lower initial levels of albumin, platelet count, and viral load were predictive risk factors for events of mortality and liver transplantation. The incidence of decompensation was significantly lower in patients treated with IFN, but age may have played a contributory role. In contrast, neither HCC development nor mortality was significantly altered by IFN therapy. In conclusion, our study indicated that patients with compensated HCV-cirrhosis in the United States progressed slowly and experienced eventual morbidity and mortality. Once decompensation develops, the disease will be more progressive and result in even higher mortality. Further studies will be required to determine the efficacy of IFN on clinical outcomes in this group of patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding HCV disease progression rates among people who inject drugs (PWID) is important to setting policy to expand access to detection, diagnosis and treatment, and in forecasting the burden of disease. In this paper we synthesize existing data on the natural history of HCV among PWID, including fibrosis progression rates (FPR) and the incidence of compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
METHODS: We conducted electronic and manual searches for published and unpublished literature. Reports were eligible if they (i) included participants who were chronically infected with HCV and reported current or previous injection drug use; (ii) presented original data on disease progression in a study sample comprised of at least 90\% PWID; (iii) published between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2013; and (iv) included data from upper-middle- or high-income countries. Quality ratings were assigned using an adaptation of the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. We estimated pooled FPRs using the stage-constant and stage-specific methods, and pooled incidence rates of CC, DC, and HCC.
RESULTS: Twenty-one reports met the study inclusion criteria. Based on random-effect models, the pooled stage-constant FPR was 0.117 METAVIR units per year (95\% CI, 0.099-0.135), and the stage-specific FPRs were F0→F1, 0.128 (95\% CI 0.080, 0.176); F1→F2, 0.059 (95\% CI 0.035, 0.082); F2→F3, 0.078 (95\% CI 0.056, 0.100); and F3→F4, 0.116 (95\% CI 0.070, 0.161). The pooled incidence rates of CC, DC, and HCC were 6.6 (95\% CI 4.8, 8.4), 1.1 (95\% CI 0.8, 1.4), and 0.3 (95\% CI -0.1, 0.6) events per 1000 person-years, respectively. Following the stage-constant estimate, average time to cirrhosis is 34 years post-infection, and time to METAVIR stage F3 is 26 years; using the stage-specific estimates, time to cirrhosis is 46 years and time to F3 is 38 years.
CONCLUSION: Left untreated, PWID with chronic HCV infection will develop liver sequelae (including HCC) in mid- to late-adulthood. Delaying treatment with the new drug regimens until advanced fibrosis develops prolongs the period of infectiousness to perhaps thirty years. Scaling up of effective HCV prevention and early engagement in care and treatment will facilitate the elimination HCV as a source of serious disease in PWID.},

METHODS: A retrospective-prospective controlled cohort design was applied. All IDUs admitted to resident drug treatment (1970-1984) and with available stored sera were screened for anti-HCV antibody. Anti-HCV positive individuals were further tested for the presence of HCV RNA. All-cause and liver-related mortality was compared between HCV RNA positive (n=328) and HCV RNA negative individuals (n=195). The observation was accomplished through register linkage to national registers. Mean observation time was 33 years.
RESULTS: All-cause mortality rate was 1.85 (95\% CI 1.62-2.11) per 100 person-years, male 2.11 (95\% CI 1.84-2.46), female 1.39 (95\% CI 1.07-1.79). Mortality rates were not influenced by persisting HCV infection. Main causes of death were intoxications (45.0\%), suicide (9.1\%), and accidents (8.2\%). Liver disease was the cause of death in 7.5\% of deaths among HCV RNA positive subjects. Five of 13 deaths among male IDUs with persisting HCV infection occurring after the age of 50 years were caused by liver disease.
CONCLUSIONS: The all-cause mortality in IDUs is high and with no difference between HCV RNA positive and HCV RNA negative individuals, the first three decades after HCV transmission. However, among IDUs with chronic HCV infection who have survived until 50years of age, HCV infection emerges as the main cause of death.},

In a noncontrolled multicenter trial, 122 treatment-naive patients received 1.5 mug/kg pegylated interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly and 800 to 1,400 mg/d ribavirin based on body weight. Treatment was stopped at week 14 in patients with EVR, defined as undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 4 and 8. Patients without EVR were assigned to 24 weeks of treatment. The primary end point was sustained virological response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA 24 weeks after end of treatment. Among the 122 patients, 95 (78\%) had EVR and received 14 weeks of treatment. The remaining 27 (22\%) were treated for 24 weeks. SVR was obtained in 85 (90\%) of 95 patients in the 14-week treatment group and 15 of (56\%) 27 in the 24-week treatment group. Altogether, SVR was obtained in 100 of 122 patients (82\%; 95\% CI, 75\%-89\%). SVR after 14 weeks of treatment was achieved more frequently among genotype 3a patients with low viral load compared with high viral load (98\% vs. 79\%; P = .019). Logistic regression analysis showed that absence of bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis was the only independent predictor of SVR. In conclusion, patients with genotype 2 or 3 and EVR obtained a high SVR after 14 weeks of treatment. The results need to be confirmed in a randomized, controlled study before this treatment approach can be recommended, particularly for patients with genotype 3 and high viral load or severe fibrosis.},

Two hundred and fourteen HCV RNA-seropositive patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis who had no previous clinical decompensation were prospectively recruited and followed up with periodic clinical and abdominal ultrasound examinations. During 114 months (range 1-199), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed in 68 (32\%), ascites in 50 (23\%), jaundice in 36 (17\%), upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 13 (6\%), and encephalopathy in 2 (1\%), with annual incidence rates of 3.9\%, 2.9\%, 2.0\%, 0.7\%, and 0.1\%, respectively.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Hepatitis C virus antiviral treatment is effective for individual patients but few active injecting drug users are treated. We considered the utility of antiviral treatment for primary prevention of hepatitis C.
METHODS: A hepatitis C transmission model among injecting drug users was developed, incorporating treatment (62.5\% average sustained viral response) with no retreatment after initial treatment failure, potential re-infection for those cured, equal genotype setting (genotype 1:genotype 2/3), and no immunity. In addition, we examined scenarios with varied treatment response rates, immunity, or retreatment of treatment failures.
RESULTS: In the baseline scenario, annually treating 10 infections per 1000 injecting drug users results in a relative decrease in hepatitis C prevalence over 10 years of 31\%, 13\%, or 7\% for baseline (untreated endemic chronic infection) prevalences of 20\%, 40\%, or 60\%, respectively. Sensitivity analyses show that including the potential for immunity has minimal effect on the predictions; prevalence reductions remain even if SVR is assumed to be 25\% lower among active IDU than current evidence suggests; retreatment of treatment failures does not alter the short-term ({\textless}5 years) projections, but does increase treatment gains within 20 years; hepatitis C free life years gained from treating active injecting drug users are projected to be higher than from treating non-injecting drug users for prevalences below 60\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the possibility of re-infection, modest rates of hepatitis C treatment among active injecting drug users could effectively reduce transmission. Evaluating and extending strategies to treat hepatitis C among active injectors are warranted.},

DESIGN: Hepatitis C virus HCV transmission modelling using U.K. estimates for effect of OST and 100\%NSP on individual risk of HCV infection.
SETTING: Range of chronic HCV prevalent (20/40/60\%) settings with no OST/100\%NSP, and U.K. setting with 50\% coverage of both OST and 100\%NSP.
PARTICIPANTS: Injecting drug users.
MEASUREMENTS: Decrease in HCV prevalence after 5-20 years due to scale-up of OST and 100\%NSP to 20/40/60\% coverage in no OST/100\%NSP settings, or from 50\% to 60/70/80\% coverage in the U.K. setting.
FINDINGS: For 40\% chronic HCV prevalence, scaling-up OST and 100\%NSP from 0\% to 20\% coverage reduces HCV prevalence by 13\% after 10 years. This increases to a 24/33\% relative reduction at 40/60\% coverage. Marginally less impact occurs in higher prevalence settings over 10 years, but this becomes more pronounced over time. In the United Kingdom, without current coverage levels of OST and 100\%NSP the chronic HCV prevalence could be 65\% instead of 40\%. However, increasing OST and 100\%NSP coverage further is unlikely to reduce chronic prevalence to less than 30\% over 10 years unless coverage becomes ≥80\%.
CONCLUSIONS: Scaling-up opiate substitution therapy and high coverage needle and syringe programmes can reduce hepatitis C prevalence among injecting drug users, but reductions can be modest and require long-term sustained intervention coverage. In high coverage settings, other interventions are needed to further decrease hepatitis C prevalence. In low coverage settings, sustained scale-up of both interventions is needed.},

Inclusion criteria were biopsy-proven cirrhosis, abnormal serum aminotransferase levels, absence of complications of cirrhosis, and exclusion of hepatitis A and B viruses and of metabolic, toxic, or autoimmune liver diseases.
RESULTS: Antibodies against hepatitis C virus were positive in 98\% of 361 patients tested. The 5-year risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was 7\% and that of decompensation was 18\%. Death occurred in 51 patients (13\%), with 70\% dying of liver disease. Survival probability was 91\% and 79\% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Two hundred five patients (53\%) were treated with interferon alfa. After adjustment for clinical and serological differences at baseline between patients treated or not treated with interferon, the 5-year estimated survival probability was 96\% and 95\% for treated and untreated patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of patients, life expectancy is relatively long, in agreement with the morbidity data showing a slowly progressive disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Epidemiological measures such as the prevalence and incidence of hard drug use are important tools for evaluating drug situations and drug policies. Models for drug use trajectories illustrate how temporary and lasting cessation of and relapse into hard drug use are other important elements in the overall picture of change in hard drug use over time. Estimating the total entry to hard drug use broadens the knowledge of the change in such use.
METHODS: The entry rate for hard drug use is defined as the sum of incident cases and relapses and estimated based on successive prevalence estimates and cessation rates.
RESULTS: The entry rate, as applied to the Norwegian case of intravenous drug use, increased from the mid-1980s to a peak in 2000, decreased up to 2003 and stabilized thereafter. The peak in Oslo appeared earlier (1998). The estimated level of the entry rate is sensitive to the rate of cessation.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that it is possible to expand the description of hard drug use epidemics beyond estimates of prevalence and incidence. The entry rate supplies a useful tool for our understanding of drug situations and decision making regarding drug policies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is common among injecting drug users. The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of risk behaviour and its association with HCV infection.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All users of the needle exchange program in Oslo, within a given time period, were eligible for inclusion in this cross-sectional study; 327 chose to participate. The users were asked about type of drug use and risk behaviour for HCV exposure in a structured interview. Sera were drawn and tested for anti HCV (EIA-3) and HCV RNA (in- house PCR).
RESULTS: The prevalence of HCV RNA was 51 \% and 81 \% had anti-HCV. A multivariate analysis revealed positive associations between anti-HCV positive status and age {\textless} 20 years at first injection, {\textgreater} 5 years of drug use, age {\textgreater} 34 years, sharing of syringes, injecting drug use while imprisoned, back-loading and use of heroin. One in five users with anti-HCV reported to never have shared syringes. However, sharing of drug paraphernalia other than needles was not associated with anti-HCV. Sharing of needles the last four weeks before the interview was more common among those living with a partner than those who lived alone.
INTERPRETATION: Most injecting drug users in Oslo have been exposed to HCV (anti HCV+) and half of them have developed chronic infection (HCV RNA+). HCV was associated with back-loading and sharing of syringes - especially during incarceration. Sharing of injection paraphernalia was not associated with being anti HCV positive.},

	abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the long-term hepatitis C (HCV) treatment outcome in former injecting drug users (IDUs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A long-term follow-up of 27 former IDUs who had been successfully treated for chronic hepatitis C was performed. These patients represented all IDUs who had obtained a sustained virological response in a Norwegian HCV treatment trial. The patients had been treated with interferon-alpha alone or in combination with ribavirin. At 5 years' follow-up the 27 IDUs were retested for HCV RNA and risk behaviour for HCV transmission after treatment was assessed. In the control group all 18 non-IDUs who had obtained a sustained virological response in the same treatment trial were included.
RESULTS: At follow-up 13-82 months (median 64) after the end of treatment only one case of probable reinfection was seen among the 27 IUDs. No reoccurrence of HCV was observed in the control group. The IDU who was HCV RNA positive at follow-up had continued injecting drugs and reported frequent needle sharing. At follow-up HCV of genotype 1a was detected in contrast to genotype 1b before treatment indicating that this patient was reinfected with HCV. A return to injecting drug use occurred in 9 (33\%) of 27 IDUs.
CONCLUSION: The long-term outcome of HCV treatment in former IDUs was excellent. Despite frequent reinitiation of drug injection all but 1 remained HCV RNA negative.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To develop a mathematical model to project the potential impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment on HCV infection prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID).
DESIGN AND SETTING: An existing model of HCV transmission among PWID was parameterised using data from Victoria, Australia, including specific parameter estimates of the number of people who are currently active injecting drug users, average duration of injecting, chronic HCV infection prevalence among PWID, annual mortality, and annual HCV treatment rate. We also explored the impact of prevalence uncertainty, program scale-up, and new treatments.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Prevalence of chronic HCV infection among people who are currently active injecting drug users.
RESULTS: With annual treatment rates of 13, 17, or 25 per 1000 PWID, the model predicts relative prevalence reductions of 20\%, 30\%, and 50\%, respectively, within 30 years. If new treatments giving higher sustained viral response rates are available in 5 years, estimated impact is increased by 21\%–23\% at 15 years, and 17\%–38\% at 30 years, depending on treatment rates.
CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests that modest rates of current HCV treatment among PWID in Victoria, Australia could halve HCV infection prevalence among PWID in 30 years. This finding suggests that interventions aimed at increasing access to HCV treatment in community clinics will benefit individual PWID and reduce HCV infection prevalence.},
